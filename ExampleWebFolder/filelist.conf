# This is a filelist for players. Developers have the same Launcher as players, only their paths are different.
# You may use exactly the same paths ofr Launcher for devs and use just different path to filelist. Thats easier,
# although less safe way of dividing dev and player stuff. In this example, there is an alternate filelistDev
# for developers, the rest of paths would be the same in Launcher's conf.

# Please, read instructions very carefully. If filelist isn't correctly set, Launcher won't be able to read it.
# In such cases, Launcher will refuse to update a game client, for safety reasons.
# Please, keep in mind that main focus of this Launcher is convenient use for its users.
# Purpouse of this Launcher is NOT to be antihack/anticheat/antiwhateverelse nazi machine.
# If you want Launcher to do such things, you need to code them. On your own.

# Hashtag symbols mark comments. They are (apart from one exception) ignored.

# Syntax for filelist elements:
# WebRelPath;Optional;LocalRelPath;LinkedList
# ; symbols must not be omitted!

#   WebRelPath -   A relative path leading to a file. Relative to web root directory. It shouldn't start with /
#                  and is FULLY CASE SENSITIVE.

#                  If a file is .zip, its considered to be zipped folder and will get unzipped. RAR, 7Z and other
#                  archives are NOT SUPPORTED and will not get extracted, although they will be downloaded like other files.
#                  Every zip file should contain (only and exactly) one folder which has exactly the same name as archive.
#                  AddOns with multiple parts should be divided into multiple zips linked to one main file via LinkedList.
#                  Note that users should not delete zip files downloaded by Launcher, otherwise files will be downloaded again anyway.

#                  Every single file mentioned in filelist or LinkedLists MUST be present on web and relative path to it
#                  must be correct. Otherwise Launcher will refuse to update a game client.


#   Optional -     1 for optional files (users can choose if they are to be kept up to date and in their client).


#   LocalRelPath - A relative path (relative to WoW's root directory) to a folder into which file is to be downloaded.
#                  It is not case sensitive (unlike web relative path). It should always start with / and end with /.
#                  If file is to be downloaded into root directory, simply enter just / symbol (for WoW.exe for example).


#   LinkedList -   A list of files, which are linked to this file and will be kept up to date if this file is kept up to date.
#                  List can be left completely blank. Its elements are being separated by , symbol, although this symbol
#                  must NEVER be at the end of LinkedList. Names of elements in LinkedList are WebRelPaths to them
#                  and have to follow exactly the same rules as WebRelPaths.

#                  Files in a LinkedList are downloaded into the same local relative path as a file they are linked from.
#                  If you want to specify relative path to some linked file, you can do so by writing a | symbol behind
#                  file's WebRelPath and follow that | symbol with file's local relative path. 
#                  Example: MainFile.ex;1;/data/;file1.ex,file2.ex|/putThisFileHere/,file3.exe|/andThisFileHere/

#                  LinkedList should never contain any file which is already in a filelist. Every single file should be mentioned in a
#                  filelist at only one place. If a file is as a main file in a filelist and in some LinkedList as well, LinkedList
#                  data for that file are overwritten by data from filelist main file. If any file happens to be in multiple
#                  LinkedLists, only the first found occurence is used.

#                  LinkedLists should be used for addons with multiple components (to keep filelist shorter and easier to read) or
#                  for optional groups. LinkedList makes possible for you to make players either download all, or none of files in a group.
#                  This may come in handy if you want players to have lets say always both optional MPQs, or none of them.
#                  If a file with (or even without) a LinkedList is optional (its an optional group/file), it appears in optinals
#                  list in Launcher's main window. Names of optional files/groups in that list are being taken from the first comment
#                  found on a line on which file is written. If no such comment is found, name of optional group is generated from names
#                  of files it contains.

#                  Chain-linking of multiple optional groups is possible and should work just fine, but is not recommended as it can become a mess.


# Example filelist (for this folder):
# MPQs:
# A isn't optional. It is in Mpqs/ folder in web's download root folder and is about to be put into local (...WoW)/data/ folder.
Mpqs/patch-a.mpq;0;/data/;
# B is optional. Name for its optional group isn't specified, so simply patch-b.mpq will be used as a name for it.
Mpqs/patch-b.mpq;1;/data/;
# Notice that D has full web local path as a name. Name for this optional group will be "Name of a group". The 2nd comment won't be shown.
Mpqs/patch-c.mpq;1;/data/;Mpqs/patch-d.mpq # Name of a group # Some internal comment.
# E is linked with an addon. Notice that addon is both in different web relative path and is to be put into different local relative path.
Mpqs/patch-e.mpq;1;/data/;addons/mpqlinkedaddon.zip|/interface/addons/ # Patch-AddOn group # Another internal invisible comment

# AddOns:
# Note that anotherAddon WILL be always kept up to date, however, Launcher can't force user to actually have this addon turned on in game.
addons/anotherAddon.zip;0;/interface/addons;
# AddOn with 3 parts. Note that you can leave spaces between data values, as all blank characters are being removed from filelist.
addons/addonPart1.zip; 1; /interface/addons; addons/addonPart2.zip, addons/addonPart3.zip # Addon with 3 components

# Misc files:
# Players need to have WoW.exe with removed lua check. Well, here it is.
